          I know some of you feel cornered by anger. I want to remind you:  
          no victory is worth the scars it leaves.  
          We can walk away and still be whole. That is strength, not weakness.

          A kind word shared here might echo longer than we realize.

          Thank you for being here. Truly.  
          This is the start of something we get to protect together.  
          A place where your voice will not be lost in the noise.
